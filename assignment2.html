<p>Louis C.K. is a comedian, actor, director, producer, writer, and editor. He
is American-born to a Hungarian family. His name is an Anglicisation of his
Hungarian last name, Szekely. He was born in Washington, D.C., but moved
to Mexico (to be specific, Mexico City), where the rest of his family lived,
when he was one year old. He lived in Mexico City until he was 7. Spanish was
his first language, but he has since forgotten most. His comedic career began
mostly when performing his material on the shows of felow comedians such as David Letterman,
Conan O'Brien, Jay Leno, and Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
